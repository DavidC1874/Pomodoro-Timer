# How to Use
1. Download the file ending with **EN.exe**  
2. Double-click to start using it  

**P.S.** If you're concerned about security, you can run it in Windows Sandbox for the first two hours, to verify its safety before using it on your desktop.  

**P.S.S.** Mac users can download the `EN.py` file and try converting it into a Mac program themselves.  

# Pomodoro Timer
- It doesn't use a countdown method that stops the program for each second, so **there will be no lag**
- Each round has **25** minutes of focus time, and the program will be closed after **4** rounds. You can take a **15-30** minute break at this point
- The break reminder will be **on top**, that is, you won’t miss it even if you're immersed in work.
- After the reminder and before the next round, the window will also **stay on top**, so if it is not minimized, it will basically not be accidentally covered by other windows and forgotten to start the next round
